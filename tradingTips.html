        <h3>Lazy Flipping</h3>
        <p>One of the best ways to make coins in FIFA is a method called lazy flipping. This method involves buying a popular, cheap gold player, for their buy it now price. Then, listing the player up for a couple hundred coins above their lowest BIN price. The best way to do this is to buy up to 100 different players and keep relisting them every hour. Not all of them will sell, so each time a player sells, immediately buy them back and relist. Repeat this process over and over and your coins will grow at a decent rate.</p>
        <h3>SBC Investing</h3>
        <p>Another great method is SBC investing. This method involves a bit more knowlege and analysis of the game over the past years to pull off. I will sum up a good SBC to invest for as an example. In previous iterations of FIFA, there has always been an SBC around Black Friday that guarentees a TOTW player. This SBC is extremely popular so the required players always go up in price. Typically the SBC requires an 83-84 rated squad. So all you have to do is buy as many cheap, high rated gold cards (83+ rating) as you can and store them in your club. Make sure to buy these cards a couple weeks before Black Friday, and when the SBC comes out the prices will be much higher, which is the perfect time to sell.</p>
