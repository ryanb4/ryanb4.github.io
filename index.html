        <div class="img-stadium-container"><img alt="Player Customization" src="images/stadium.jpg"></div>
        <h3 class="alignLeft">Create Your Player</h3>
        <p>The first step in beginning your pro clubs journey is creating your pro. There are many customization options including your name, number, and country to name a few. Even more extensive is the amount of appearance customizaiton options. You can change your pro's hair style, celebrations, height, and weight. Height and weight is especially important because it affects your physical attributes such as pace and strength.</p>
        <div class="imgContainer"><img alt="Player Customization" src="images/playerCustomization.jpg"></div>
        <p>Oftentimes, more experience players set their players to the smallest possible height (5'4") in order to have the fastest player possible rather than a stronger, slower player. </p>
        
        <h3 class="alignLeft">Base Match XP</h3>
        <p>The best way to level up your pro clubs player is through playing seasons matches with your club. After each game, you will get a rating based on your performance. Your rating can be seen in the bottom left corner when you are in a match. The more XP you get, the more your player will level up in key stats based on your pro's position. For example, a striker with an 8.5 match rating will get 1100 XP towards the main stats of a striker such as strength, reactions, acceleration, sprint speed, finishing, etc. </p>

        <p>To get a high match rating, you have to make sure to complete passes, stay in position, win tackles, and score goals. In general, if you try to help your team win, you will get a good match rating.</p>

        <h3 class="alignLeft">Skill Points</h3>

        <p>Another good way to level up your pro is through skill points. When you reach a specific milestones of games played you will be awarded with skill points. These skills points can be applied to your player in order to upgrade attributes in one of six categories: Pace, Dribbling, Shooting, Defending, Physical, and Passing. Once you have played 100 matches, you will stop receiving skills points and you will be left with 110 skill points to spend on your player. The way points are divided up into each skill category is entirely up to you. Although, typically players will upgrade stats that will help in their pro's position. For example, it is often a good choice to upgrade your striker's shooting with extra skill points.</p>

        <p>After you understand how to level up and customize your pro, the next step is to get a group of friends to form a club and start to climb up the divisions!</p>
