                    <h3>START THE GAME</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        First, you will need the jar file to play the game. Download the jar file by clicking the "play" button. Ensure you
                        have the lastest version of java installed.
                        Then, open the terminal and type:
                    </p>
                    
                    <code>java -jar connect-four.jar</code>
                    
                    <p>Note that <code>connect-four.jar</code> should be replaced by the path to the jar file on your machine.</p>
                    
                    <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>

                    <p>
                        To play Connect Four, make sure you have a friend with you. The color that goes first will appear in the bottom left corner.
                        Each column becomes highlighted when the mouse hovers over it. Left click on the mouse to drop your piece to 
                        the bottom of the highlighted column. Then, it will be the next person's turn and so on. The first person to get 
                        four of their pieces in a row (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) wins! The winner will be indicated in the bottom left 
                        hand corner and the winning pieces will become highlighted. To play again, hit the restart button. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

                    <p>
                        I coded this game at the beginning of my computer science journey. This is an example of how not to implement connect four.
                        To test if a player had won the game by getting four pieces in a row, I would checked every single possible combination of four
                        pieces on the board to see if one of those combinations had been satisfied. This check would occur everytime a piece was placed. 
                        This method is very ineffcient because I would check four positions where the last piece played was not even a part of the checked locations.
                        A much better implementation would have been to check if there are four pieces in any direction, starting from the 
                        most recent piece played. This method would have avoided checking every single combination on the board.
