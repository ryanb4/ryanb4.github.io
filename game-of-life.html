                    <p>
                        Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton where the state of each cell is determined by the state of its neighbors.
                        A neighbor is considered to be any of the eight cells surrounding a particular cell. There are three rules
                        that determine the state of a cell. If a cell is live and has two or three live neighebors, it remains alive. 
                        If a cell is dead and it has exactly three live neighbors, it becomes live. All other live cells die and all other 
                        dead cells remain dead.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This project began a few years ago as a class assignment and I recenelty came back to it using techniques 
                        outside of the assignment guidelines. Many of the GUI components and setup was based on this 
                        <a class="recent-work-text" href="https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/Java/Swing" target="_blank">code.</a>
                        I made adjustments to the logic flow, altered component locations, and added new gameplay features.

                    <h3>START THE GAME</h3>
                    
                    <p>
                        First, you will need the jar file to play the game. Download the jar file by clicking the "play" button. Ensure you
                        have the lastest version of java installed.
                        Then, open the terminal and type:
                    </p>
                    
                    <code>java -jar Conway's-Game-of-Life.jar</code>
                    
                    <p>Note that <code>Conway's-Game-of-Life.jar</code> should be replaced by the path to the jar file on your machine.</p>
                    
                    <h3>HOW TO PLAY</h3>

                    <p>
                        The gameboard appears as a large grid. Live cells appear as black squares and dead cells appear as empty squares.
                        Left click with your mouse to make individual cells live. Left click and drag to make multiple cells live. You can autofill
                        the gameboard by clicking "Game" then "Autofill." This window allows the user to select the percent of the gameboard to fill 
                        with live cells. If you would like to clear the live cells from the gameboard, click the "Reset Board" button.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Click the "step" button in order to have the cells go through one generation. For each step, the three rules of the
                        game are checked and applied to the gameboard. Click "play" and the game will continuously apply the rules and update
                        the gameboard. The default move speed is three per second. Click on "Game" then "Move Speed" to alter the number of 
                        moves per second. If you would like to stop the game from automatically progressing, click the "stop" button.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You can customize the size of each individual cell. To do this, click on "Game" then "Block Size." Now you can 
                        make the cells larger or smaller to better see how the cells interact or to fit more cells in the window. Lastly, you can 
                        resize the window or go full screen to watch the Game of Life unfold in all of its glory.
                    </p>
